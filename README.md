# JK-Fitness
I was born July 12th, 1996 on Long Island New York. My father(RIP) started training me from the young age of 5 in a multitude of sports, including but not limited to Boxing, Basketball, Wrestling to name a few examples. However his overall philosophy towards training me from that young of an age was not just solely for the physical benefits but also to ensure that I would be able to overcome all adversity and challenges in my life. This background in my life led to my philosophy towards training, which is that I strongly believe training the body to overcome pain and adversity, leads to a person being able to overcome the mental and emotional rollercoaster that is life.
